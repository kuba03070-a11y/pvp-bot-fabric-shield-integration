| `/pvpbot massspawn <count>` | Spawn multiple bots with random names (1-50) |

### Examples

```mcfunction

/pvpbot spawn Guard1

# Spawn 10 bots with random names (10% chance for special names)
/pvpbot massspawn 10

# Remove the bot
/pvpbot remove Guard1

# See all bots
/pvpbot list
```

**Note:** When spawning bots with random names, there's a 10% chance they will get a special name (`nantag` or `Stepan1411`) instead of a generated name.
